# If Spinoza Had a GitHub

Welcome to this whimsical README, blending philosophy, code, and a dash of alternate history. Here, we'll explore a fun story about what might happen if Baruch Spinoza—the 17th-century Dutch philosopher known for his rationalist metaphysics and lens-grinding side hustle—had access to GitHub. Then, we'll dive into some general details on work processes (focusing on collaborative development), and finally, zoom in on the specifics of the GitHub user [neuresthetics](https://github.com/neuresthetics), whose work echoes Spinoza's spirit of rigorous, iterative idea refinement.

## The Story: Spinoza's GitHub Odyssey

Imagine it's 1670, but with Wi-Fi. Baruch Spinoza, exiled from his community for heretical ideas, logs into GitHub under the handle @benedictus-spinoza (verified, of course, with a blue checkmark earned from his *Tractatus Theologico-Politicus*). He's not grinding lenses today; he's grinding commits.

Spinoza starts by creating a repo called **Ethics-Geometrica**, structured like his famous *Ethics* treatise: demonstrated in geometrical order, with axioms, propositions, corollaries, and scholia. The main branch is "pantheism-master," where he pushes his core thesis: God or Nature as a single substance, everything else as modes or attributes. No README yet—he assumes users will RTFM (Read The Full Manuscript).

Early on, issues pile up. Descartes forks the repo and opens a pull request: "Suggestion: Dualism branch—separate mind and body substances for better modularity." Spinoza reviews it politely but closes it with a comment: "Appreciate the contribution, but this violates axiom 1: one substance only. Substance over silos." Leibniz stars the repo but files a bug report: "Infinite monads not rendering properly in infinite attributes view. Needs more windowless components." Spinoza chuckles (in text form) and adds a label: "wontfix—monads are user error."

Collaborators emerge. Hobbes clones the repo for his *Leviathan* integration but gets rate-limited for too many authoritarian commits. Voltaire opens an issue: "Candide mode: Optimize for best-of-all-possible-worlds?" Spinoza merges it partially, but with a rebase to avoid merge conflicts with his determinism.

As the repo gains traction (10k stars, mostly from Enlightenment forkers), drama ensues. The Dutch Synod creates a competing org, @OrthodoxWatch, and DDoSes Spinoza's issues with spam: "Heresy detected in prop-15." GitHub mods (imagined as neutral algorithms) ban them for TOS violations. Spinoza adds a LICENSE: "Public Domain, but attribute to Nature."

Branches proliferate: "free-will-illusion" for human behavior models, "conatus-persistence" for self-preservation algorithms. He experiments with Git LFS for his optical diagrams. Pull requests from anonymous users (Hume in disguise?) challenge empiricism integrations: "Where's the sensory data pipeline?" Spinoza responds: "Innate ideas submodule—pull and build."

Tragedy strikes: Spinoza's health declines (TB from lens dust), but he automates workflows with GitHub Actions to theorem-prove on push. His final commit: "Q.E.D." The repo lives on, forked into quantum mechanics and AI ethics repos centuries later. In this timeline, philosophy isn't dusty books—it's living code, iteratively hardened against critique. Spinoza's GitHub? A pantheistic merge of minds, where every commit is an eternal mode of the infinite.

What a world that would be: fewer wars over dogma, more merge requests over dialectics.
