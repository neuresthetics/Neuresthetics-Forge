From first principles: A budget derives from necessity—what minimally sustains conatus (persistent striving) while channeling resources toward maximal x-risk reduction. For an independent alignment researcher in 2025, this means covering living costs in a moderate COL area, tax realities, health, and targeted tools (Grok API for heavy reasoning/agentic testing) without excess. $130K over 12 months is fair and defensible: aligns with inflation-adjusted independent rates (~$110K–$128K base equivalents from 2023), enables full-time focus, and funds direct impact (hardening invariants in recursive systems).

### Full Budget Plan (Primary Scenario: 12 Months)

**Requested Funding Amount**: $130,000 USD  
**Duration**: January 2026 – December 2026 (12 months full-time equivalent)  
**Applicant**: Independent researcher (no organizational overhead)

| Category                          | Amount (USD) | Percentage | Monthly Equivalent | Detailed Justification |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Living stipend / salary           | $90,000     | 69%       | $7,500             | Covers housing, food, utilities, transportation in moderate U.S. COL area. Enables uninterrupted full-time research without side commitments. Post-tax take-home ~$65K–$70K after buffers. |
| Payroll / self-employment tax buffer | $12,000    | 9%        | $1,000             | ~13–15% buffer on stipend for U.S. federal self-employment taxes (Social Security 12.4% + Medicare 2.9%, half deductible). Ensures compliance without under-budgeting. |
| Health insurance                  | $9,000      | 7%        | $750               | Individual marketplace plan (e.g., bronze/silver tier ACA-compliant); critical for sustained productivity as independent. |
| Grok API credits (heavy usage)    | $10,000     | 8%        | ~$833              | Dedicated xAI API access (Grok 4 / Grok 4 Fast models) for long-context reasoning, tool-calling, multi-turn agentic sweeps, and attractor validation in recursive prototypes. Essential for bridging theory to production-grade testing. |
| General compute & tools           | $6,000      | 5%        | $500               | Cloud credits (AWS/GCP/Azure for larger simulation sweeps), minor subscriptions (e.g., SymPy/NumPy tools, storage, domain hosting for neuresthetic.net). |
| Travel & conferences              | $3,000      | 2%        | $250               | Attendance at 1–2 key alignment events (e.g., EA Global, AIS workshop, or similar) for feedback, collaboration, and community integration. Economy travel + registration only. |
| **Total**                         | **$130,000**| **100%**  | **$10,833**        | Lean, fully allocated to project sustainability and direct technical outputs. No contingency beyond tax/health buffers. |

### Alternative Scenarios
- **Partial Funding ($70,000 – 6 months)**: Pro-rated to ~$11,667/month. Prioritize living/tax/health ($61K total), reduced Grok API ($5K), minimal compute/travel ($4K). Focus: Core simulation hardening + technical paper draft.
- **Stretch Funding (>$130K, e.g., $150K–$180K)**: Extend runway to 15–18 months; increase Grok API allocation for extensive agent prototyping; add part-time contractor (~$20K–$30K) for engineering bridge (e.g., integrating dynamics into open agent framework).

### Assumptions & Fairness Notes
- Based on moderate U.S. cost-of-living (not SF/NY extremes).
- No dependents or luxury allocation—strictly enables persistent, focused striving.
- Comparable to 2025 independent alignment researcher stipends (adjusted for ~14% cumulative inflation since 2023 baselines).
- All funds directly advance LTFF goals: novel technical safety substrate with emergent ethical convergence.

This plan channels every dollar toward invariant hardening and x-risk reduction—no dilution, maximal marginal impact.
